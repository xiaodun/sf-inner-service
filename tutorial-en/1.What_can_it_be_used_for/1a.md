Usually the front-end storage means is dependent on the host environment.

Taking browsers as an example, there are `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`, etc. They have significant drawbacks

- Can only be stored in the current browser, not across devices, some scenarios are not suitable
- There are many restrictions on storage types and operation methods

In a real project, some things that cannot be done by pure front-end will be done through interfaces, and the related language (Java) has a high cost of getting started on the front-end, and it will be cumbersome compared to what to do.

sf-inner-service is an npm package, written based on node.js, which is easy to integrate. It can respond to interface calls and do some things that cannot be done at the browser level, such as:

- Operate the files on the disk to add, delete, modify and check
- Store pictures, videos, compressed packages
- Convert third-party images to base64 and return them to the front end without being affected by security policies
- Realize upload and download

The front end can use this tool to do some practical functions, you can refer to sf-notes https://github.com/xiaodun/sf-notes
