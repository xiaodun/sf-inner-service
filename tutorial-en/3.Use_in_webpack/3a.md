No matter what scenario is used, its essence is to send the request to the server

````
npm install --save-dev sf-inner-service

````

One project corresponds to one server

Create a new service folder and create a new "sfInnerService.js" below, the content is as follows

````
const sfInnerService = require("sf-inner-service");
sfInnerService.start({
  prefix: "api",
  port: 8091,
  dataFloderName: "data",
});

````

Execute `node sfInnerService.js`

When the server receives a request, all relevant file structures are created under "service/data"

# Resolve OPTIONS requests generated across domains

If the request address is written directly to the server, cross-domain will inevitably occur.

You can set up a proxy. This different scaffolding has its own methods, so I will not list them one by one.

Can use nginx proxy

# start with the project

Can write a bat file in windows system

service.bat

````
cd service
node-sfInnerService.js
````

But if the program crashes, the interface will be turned off directly, you can write another bat to start service.bat

start-service.bat

````
start service.bat
````

Modify the startup command in package.json to start the server and the project together

E.g:

````
start-service.bat && npm run dev
````

# ignore data files

In actual use, it is good to store some data locally, and it is not suitable to push it to github.

Main points ignore data file updates, .gitignore example

````
service/data/**/*.json
service/data/**/upload_*
````

Then create a new local branch to keep the data
