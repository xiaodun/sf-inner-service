The ability to provide websocket is mainly for the purpose of front-end self-practice. Of course, it also has the basis for realizing complex functions, but under the premise that there is only one overall situation, you need to spend some time on code segmentation.

## enable function

Two parameters should be added when starting the service, indicating that the webSocket function is enabled and the listening port is set.

````
   isOpenWebSocket: true,
   webSocket: {
     port: 8092,
   },

````

# Implementation process

After the server receives the websocket message, if it finds that there is no websocket.js file, it will be automatically created and initialized as follows

````
(function(){
     return function(argData){
         let senData = {}
         return senData;
     }
})()
````

websocket.js is executed every time a message is received

`argData` is the content sent by the front end, the server has processed it once through the `JSON.parse` function

`return` is the content returned to the front end, the server will execute the `JSON.stringify` function once
