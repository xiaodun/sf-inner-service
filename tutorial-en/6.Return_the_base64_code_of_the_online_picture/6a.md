This example is a demonstration of the capabilities of node.js, expanding the user's thinking

Enter a web page image address in the text box, such as: https://t7.baidu.com/it/u=4198287529,2774471735&fm=193&f=GIF, after clicking Parse, the interface will return the base64 code

The code of getBase64.js is as follows:

````

(function () {
   return function (argData, argParams) {
     const request = require("sync-request");

     const imgRsp = request("get", argParams.url);
     let bytes = new Uint8Array(imgRsp.getBody());
     const data = Buffer.from(bytes, "utf8").toString("base64");
     return {
       isWrite: false,
       response: {
         code: 200,
         data,
       },
     };
   };
})();

Initiate a request to get image information, and then convert it to base64 code

`sync-request` is a third-party library for synchronous requests, which needs to be installed. If this function is implemented in a browser environment, it will encounter cross-domain problems
