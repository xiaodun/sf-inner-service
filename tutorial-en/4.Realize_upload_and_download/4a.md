Live Server will trigger a refresh even if the non-html page is changed, and sf-inner-service will automatically generate a copy when it detects that there is a file upload. The combination of the two causes the page to refresh when the upload button is clicked..., you can Rename the file to disable the plugin.

# Get information about the uploaded file

First of all, don't forget to initialize the content of manage.json to "[]". By outputting `argParams` in uplaod.js, you can find that the server has encapsulated the uploaded content, the format is as follows

````
  files: [
    {
      name: 'Order record.xls',
      type: 'application/vnd.ms-excel',
      flag: 'upload_ca611dd4ada8862ebd685005e096776c'
    }
  ]
````

`name` is the name uploaded by the user

`type` is the file type

`flag` is the identifier used by the server to distinguish different files, and the file upload_ca611dd4ada8862ebd685005e096776c is also generated

Next upload.js only needs to store this information

# How to get the uploaded file information

The implementation of the interface to get the upload list will not be repeated, see getFilelist.js

# How to implement the download

sf-inner-service has implemented the download file logic internally, and will return the blob format to the front end. In download.js, you only need to tell the server the file information and actions to download. The specific logic can be seen in the comments.

# How to delete information

You only need to tell the server the behavior to be deleted and the file information, and the program will delete it automatically. In addition, deleting the data in manage.json still needs to be implemented by yourself. For the specific logic, see the comments in delete.js
