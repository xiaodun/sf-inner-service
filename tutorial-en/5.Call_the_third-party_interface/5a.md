sf-inner-service is based on the node.js environment. When writing backend scripts, you can also use built-in packages and install third-party packages to do things that cannot be done in browsers, such as cross-domain requests.

# implement async

Enter a page address in the text box, for example: https://www.google.com, the interface will return the source code of the page after clicking the request

The backend scripts managed by sf-inner-service are executed synchronously by default. This has the disadvantage that when the execution logic of a script is too long, subsequent requests will be blocked. You can set the property to return asynchronously, fetchOtherDomainUrl.js code show as below

````
(function () {
  return function (argData, argParams, external) {
    const request = require("request");

    request(argParams.url, function (error, response, body) {
      external.response.end(JSON.stringify(body));
    });
    return {
      async: true,
      response: {
        code: 200,
      },
    };
  };
})();
````

`request` is a third party, it needs to be installed and can be used to initiate a request. When there is `async: true,` in the return property, you need to decide the timing of the return by yourself

At this time, the `response` in the formal parameter `external` is used to terminate the request and return the content to the front end.

# synchronous request

Below is the implementation of synchronization

````
(function () {
  return function (argData, argParams) {
    const request = require("sync-request");

    const rsp = request("get", argParams.url);
    let data = rsp.getBody("utf8");
    return {
      isWrite: false,

      response: {
        code: 200,
        data,
      },
    };
  };
})();

````

`sync-request` is third party and needs to be installed
