This example mainly introduces the relevant functions of the global life cycle file lifeCycle.js

When you enter the name of the book in the text box, click save, it will pop up "This interface is restricted from use"

The global lifeCycle.js file will be automatically created with the following contents:

````
(function () {
  return function () {
    return {
      ajaxInterceptor: function (argData, argParams, external) {
        return {
          allowNextStep: true,
          response: {
            //returned data
            code: 200,
            data: {},
          },
        };
      },
    };
  };
})();

````

`ajaxInterceptor` is a function that is executed before other backend scripts, and its parameters are the same as those injected by ordinary scripts

Execution will continue only when `allowNextStep` returns `true`, and the corresponding `response` will take effect when `allowNextStep` returns `false`

It is very simple to implement the interception function, external.request.url can get the url of the current request

````
        if (["/api/book/save"].includes(external.request.url)) {
          allowNextStep = false;
        }

````

If the above restrictions are removed, you can continue to add books
